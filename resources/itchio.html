<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Kanji Match</strong> is an educational game designed to help you master visually similar Japanese kanji. By focusing on kanji that are often confused due to their appearance, the game helps reinforce subtle distinctions and deepen your recognition skills. Kanji Match uses the WaniKani API to fetch your personalized kanji data, so an active WaniKani subscription is required.
